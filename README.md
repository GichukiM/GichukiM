👋 Hello, I'm Collins Gichuki Muchiri!

🌱 I began my coding journey in April, 2023 and am currently enrolled in Moringa School's Full Stack Software Engineering program. I specialize in Frontend Development and have hands-on experience crafting engaging user interfaces.

🌐 Check out my portfolio at [gichukimuchiri.com](https://gichukimuchiri.com) to explore my projects and contributions in detail.

💼 I also have experience in developing a coaching website, [GrowHub Coaching Services](https://growhubcoachingservices.co.ke).

🏃‍♂️ Fun fact: I'm a dedicated runner and you'll catch me wearing shorts any day - I just can't stand trousers!

📚 Currently learning Back-end development to build robust full-stack applications and ensure seamless user experiences across devices by managing server-side logic and database interactions.

🤝 I'm looking forward to collaborating on frontend projects, and in the future, I'm eager to delve into backend development as well.
