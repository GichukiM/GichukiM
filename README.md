👋 Hello, I'm Collins Gichuki Muchiri!

🌱 I began my coding journey in April last year and am currently enrolled in Moringa School's Full Stack Software Engineering program. I specialize in Frontend Development and have hands-on experience crafting engaging user interfaces.

🌐 Check out my portfolio at [gichukimuchiri.com](https://gichukimuchiri.com) to explore my projects and contributions in detail.

💼 I also have experience in developing a coaching website, [GrowHub Coaching Services](https://growhubcoachingservices.co.ke).

🏃‍♂️ Fun fact: I'm a dedicated runner and you'll catch me wearing shorts any day - I just can't stand trousers!

📚 Currently, I'm learning Bootstrap to create more responsive projects, enhancing user experiences across devices.

🤝 I'm looking forward to collaborating on frontend projects, and in the future, I'm eager to delve into backend development as well.

📧 Feel free to reach out to me at gichukimuchiri80@gmail.com or info@gichukimuchiri.com for inquiries or collaborations.

📚 **Education**: 
- Full Stack Software Engineering Program at Moringa School (Feb - August[2024])

🌟 Excited to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts, exchange knowledge, and embark on new coding adventures!
